This repo collects skills for one workflow: publishing an AI rule file to GitHub. PRs that fit that scope are welcome.

## Entry Format

Each skill in this repo follows the same structure:

```
skills/{skill-name}/
  └── SKILL.md
```

`SKILL.md` is plain markdown with a YAML front matter holding `name`, `description`, and `license`.

## Requirements

Submissions must:

- Cover a step in the publishing pipeline that existing skills do not already handle
- Use the five-segment description method (main trigger, positive enumeration, colloquial triggers, edge case expansion, negative samples)
- Include a Quick Start section and a Common Mistakes section with at least two items
- Pass the de-AI checklist in `skills/polish-rule-content/SKILL.md`
- Be tested against at least one agent before submission

## Quality Gate

> [!NOTE]
> Skills that overlap an existing skill's scope, lack negative samples, or use vague constraints ("be careful", "follow best practices") will be closed without review.

## PR Title Format

Good:
- `Add {skill-name}: {one-line description}`
- `Fix {skill-name}: {what changed and why}`

Not good:
- `Update README`
- `Add my skill`

## What Gets Rejected

- Skills that duplicate an existing skill's scope without clear differentiation
- Skills not tested against the target agent before submission
- Bumping version numbers in commits that touch unrelated files

## Process

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your skill under `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`, alphabetically among the pipeline skills
3. Update the README's "Skills" section with a link to the new file
4. Open a PR with the title format above

For changes to existing skills, describe what the change fixes and confirm you tested it.
